<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSTIhWBvXIY">Youtube video</a></p>

<h3>Chorus</h3>
<p>
  Would you marry me, cause as far as I can see, I want no one else<br />

  Would you marry me, since mentioning <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft_3">Warcraft 3</a>, I've been
  yours, all yours
</p>

<p>
  We've been together, 6 years, 2 months and 20 days<br />

  Don't lie you've been dropping hints, and I haven't known what to say<br />

  But I can't wait any longer, so time to see
</p>

<p>(Disclaimer about the ring)</p>

<p>Caitlin will you marry me</p>

<p>(Pause, go home if she says no. If she says yes continue with song)</p>

<p>
  That's good cause the songs not over<br />
  
  but that's a weight off my shoulder
</p>

<p>
  If I'm <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gears_of_War#Characters">Marcus</a> you're
  my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gears_of_War#Characters">Dominic</a>,
  <br />

  If you're <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratchet_%26_Clank_(series)">Rachet</a>
  I'm your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratchet_%26_Clank_(series)">Clank</a><br
  />

  If I'm <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft">leveling to
  80</a>, I want you as my <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank_(computer_gaming)">tank</a>
</p>

<p>
  In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(US_TV_series)">The Office</a> you'd be <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pam_Beesly">Pam</a> and I'd work to be your
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Halpert">Jim</a><br />

  except if we were <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(UK_TV_series)">British</a>,
  then I'd be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Canterbury">Tim</a>
</p>

<p>
  I'll be <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_and_Norah%27s_Infinite_Playlist">Nick</a>
  and you'll be <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_and_Norah%27s_Infinite_Playlist">Norah</a>,
  searching for a band<br />

  I'm <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidus">Tidus</a> and you're <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuna_(Final_Fantasy)">Yuna</a>, except that
  I'm not dead
</p>

<p>
  but if you were a <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Dead#Behavior">zombie</a>, I
  possibly let you eat my brains<br />

  if you were software you'd be <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs">Emacs</a>, you know how much that
  means!
</p>

<p>
  and I didn't buy you a diamond,<br />
  
  Cause we were watching that <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Numb3rs_episodes#Season_5:_2008-2009">episode</a>
  of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numb3rs">Numb3rs</a>, where they
  found that big diamond<br />
  
  And you were like "I hate the diamond industry"<br />

  and I was like "Great, that saves me a lot of money."
</p>

<p>
  Cause my OCD,<br />

  means I want the rings to be perfect and be pretty<br />

  and I wanted this to be a surprise<br />

  So I'll buy the rings in due time.
</p>

<p>
  and for now you get this song,<br />
  
  I worked on it all month long,<br />
  
  Well actually ... only the days when you weren't home<br />

  So collectively it's about only 4 hours old
</p>

<h3>Chorus</h3>
<p>
  Would you marry me, cause as far as I can see, I want no one else<br />

  Would you marry me, since mentioning <a
